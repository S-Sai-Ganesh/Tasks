2. Starting the server in vs code using npm start. 
3. Opening http://localhost:3000/vehicles-available to check the available vehicles.
4. As I have not developped the frontend we will book the vehicle via API, using http://localhost:3000/vehicle-book/:id?t=ms. where id stands for id of vehicle and t is in seconds.
5. After successful booking the page directs to all vehicles.
6. Database will be updated as per the booking with time.
